Java wrapper for jjwt

# Ghost JWT wrapper

For a migration project from Wordpress to Ghost CMS, I needed to migrate all my articles (several thousand) to Ghost .

I have not found a Java implementation to generate tokens for Ghost so I created a very very simple one, it can be used for other people.

The Ghost Admin API is accessible through authentication by JWT token.
